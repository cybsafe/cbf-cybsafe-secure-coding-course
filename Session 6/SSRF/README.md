# Server Side Request Forgery

## Install

You will need to install flask (a simple Python web framework) by running:

    pip3 install flask

## Running the server

To run the server:

    export FLASK_APP=ssrf
    flask run

The server will print a localhost address to the console that you can access via your browser.
